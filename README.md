# LuaBF
not very simple brainfuck interpreter made in lua

you run it like this:
`lua LuaBF.lua (file that contains your code)`

append -d to the end of the command to make the program dump the final tape. the tape is 30,000 cells long btw so good luck finding your output

this is brainfuck btw: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
